# MULTIPLAYER CONNECT4
 It helps to design a game using Python and socket programming. It contains four steps: an Interface, Python codes, socket programming giving connections, and a final scoreboard.
In this Multiplayer Connect4 game, we can play the game with 4 members at a time and n number of game plays in one server.
Im trying to update the databse for this and the score board and some advance features like the ai and improved version of client-server architecture.
